## Artificial Intelligence Unit Projects - Second Semester (1CS)

These are the projects we worked on during the second semester of the Artificial Intelligence Module:

## 1. Shortest Path Finder
- Uses OSMnx + NetworkX + Tkinter.
- Specify two points on the map (e.g., Bejaia, Algeria) and the program will find the shortest driving route.

## 2. Session Scheduling Using CSP
- Solves the scheduling problem using python-constraint.
- Constraints: No overlapping sessions, no 4-5 consecutive time slots, and teacher allocation is taken into account.

## 3. Alpha-Beta Pruning Visualizer
- Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Animates the tree exploration process using Matplotlib + NetworkX.
